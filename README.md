# hello-world
first steps


Hi guys!

My name is Tatjana and I´m looking forward to explore GitHub.
I´m a Productowner and AI-Manager in a transport company. In my team I have a lot of developer and they already use GitLab that is why I am happy to learn more about this topic. From now on I can understand their terminology and their issues better than before.

Best
Tatjana
